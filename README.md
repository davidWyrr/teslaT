## Project Title: Dave App

This project is a simple  application based on a Figma design. from the infomation on the figma design and my understanding of it , this application allow tracking of user , tracking of activities using custom filter components and also display relevant graphical representation of data regarding the activities, user leaderboard and so.on 

**Ideas and Planning:**

I aimed to create a lightweight and user-friendly app that aligns well with the figma design and also has  a well stuctured reusable component and  clean UI. I explored using Vuetify for component styling and animation 
**Execution:**
The application is structured with seperate components for dropdown to better align with the design and also display my expertise with Vue.js . Data is managed using Vuex for state management. grapical representations of data are implemented using apexChart ( an open source javascript chart library licensed under MIT)
